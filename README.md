- ❌ Removed database migrations and models
- ❌ Removed complex authentication system
- ❌ Removed payment integration
- ❌ Removed booking system backend

### Frontend Complexity
- ❌ Removed Bootstrap framework
- ❌ Removed complex "How it Works" section with detailed instructions
- ❌ Simplified train information display
- ❌ Removed advanced features and animations

## What remains:

### ✅ Simple Frontend
- Clean HTML structure
- Tailwind CSS for styling (CDN)
- Basic responsive design
- Simple navigation
- Train search form (frontend only)
- Train information display
- Mobile-friendly design

### ✅ Core Features (Demo Only)
- Train search interface

├── index.html              # Main homepage
├── train-information.html  # Train info page
└── README.md               # This file
```

## How to Run:
1. Open `index.html` in any web browser
2. Or serve it through a web server (XAMPP, etc.)
